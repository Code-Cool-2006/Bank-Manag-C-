Title: C++ Based Bank Management System

Objectives

To design and develop a C++ based Bank Management System.
To automate the process of account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and account management.
To implement Object Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.
To provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for handling banking transactions.
Methodology

Study and analyze the requirements of a simple banking system.
Design the system using algorithm and flowchart.
Implement the system using C++ programming language.
Use conditional statements, loops, functions, and dynamic memory management (new/delete) for program flow.
Test the application for correct calculations, account searching, and data updates.
Outcomes

Successful development of a menu-driven C++ application.
Efficient management of account details and fund transfers.
Improved understanding of OOP concepts and manual memory management in C++.
Ability to design and implement real-time applications.
Algorithm

Start
Display menu options
Create Account
Show All Accounts
Search Account
Deposit Amount
Withdraw Amount
Delete Account
Exit
Read user choice
If user selects Create Account:
Accept account number, name, and initial balance
Dynamically resize array and add new account
If user selects Show All Accounts, display details of all registered accounts
If user selects Search Account:
Accept account number
Find and display specific account details
If user selects Deposit or Withdraw:
Accept account number and amount
Update the balance ensuring sufficient funds for withdrawal
If user selects Delete Account, remove the account and resize the array
If user selects Exit, terminate the program
Stop
